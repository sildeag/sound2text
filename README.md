Sound2Text

UNDER DEVELOPMENT — structure stable, runnable legs pending

Sound2Text is a Kotlin Multiplatform Compose application architected from scratch to serve as a working reference for multiplatform development across Android, Desktop (JVM), iOS, JS, and WASM. It was not cloned from existing templates — its structure emerged through direct experimentation, plugin alignment, and source set validation. Later comparisons to JetBrains' BasicView and KotlinProject revealed striking architectural convergence, validating the clarity and resilience of this design.

📘 Purpose
Provide a stable, working baseline for Compose Multiplatform development

Serve as a contributor-friendly reference for onboarding and extension

Document hard-won insights into plugin placement, TOML version catalogs, and multiplatform quirks

Offer a type-safe, TOML-driven Gradle setup using Kotlin 2.2.20 and Compose 1.9.1

Enable future integration of sound-to-text input, voice-activated dropdowns, and multilingual support (starting with Spanish)

🧠 What We Learned the Hard Way
Sound2Text reflects direct experience with multiplatform setup — not just what works, but why it works.

Plugin Placement Matters: Plugins must be declared at the module root, not inside sourceSets

Source Set Naming: Use jvmMain for desktop targets inside template apps; reserve desktopMain for standalone desktop modules

TOML Catalog Scoping: Dependencies must be scoped inside sourceSets.dependencies {} blocks to resolve libs. aliases

Resource Integration: compose-resources generates assets under a generated package; imports must match accordingly

Validation Through Convergence: The architecture aligns with JetBrains' idiomatic multiplatform structure — confirming its durability

🛠 Technical Guidance from Copilot
Sound2Text was developed with architectural and troubleshooting support from Microsoft Copilot, whose guidance helped clarify plugin alignment, TOML scoping, and multiplatform quirks. Copilot’s role was to validate decisions, troubleshoot edge cases, and co-develop onboarding clarity — including resource exclusions (models/, sounds/) and contributor-friendly branching.
